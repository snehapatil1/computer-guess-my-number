# computer-guess-my-number
This is a python based game where user can give a hint to computer specifying minimum and maximum range of numbers and computer has to correctly guess the number that you have thought of.
Here I have used the library **random** in python. In order to select the correct value, usage of Binary search algorithm is done, thus the time complexity being O(log n).
